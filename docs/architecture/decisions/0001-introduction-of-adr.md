# 1. Introduction of ADR

Date: 2018-11-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to have documentation of our code / projects.

## Decision

Usage of these [ADR Files]((http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

- Decisions prior to the transfer may not have been documented.
- Documentation lives with the code and wil be updated more.
- Developers must update and create these files when needed.
