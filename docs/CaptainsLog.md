## 27/11/2018 - Using PATCH
### HTTP PATCH
HTTP PATCH requests are to make partial update on a resource. 
If you see PUT requests also modify a resource entity so to make more clear – PATCH method is the correct choice for partially updating an existing resource and PUT should only be used if you’re replacing a resource in its entirety.
